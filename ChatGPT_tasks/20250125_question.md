# FLAX/JAX Coding Problem of the Day

## Objective

- Implement a logistic regression model using Flax NNX API for binary classification. The goal is to:

1. Define a simple model using Flax’s NNX module (nnx.Linear).

2. Train the model using Optax for optimization.

3. Evaluate its performance on a test dataset.

## Hints

- Use nnx.Linear to create a single-layer model.

- Apply jax.nn.sigmoid to output probabilities.

- Use optax.binary_cross_entropy as the loss function.

- Use optax.adam for optimization.

## Reivew

our implementation demonstrates a solid understanding of the Flax NNX API and logistic regression fundamentals. Here are a few points to consider for refinement:

RNG Handling:

Passing nnx.Rngs(42) directly when instantiating the module works, but it’s helpful to ensure consistency if you’re planning multiple runs. Consider using jax.random.PRNGKey(seed) to generate an RNG key and passing it through NNX’s Rngs mechanism.
Double-check that nnx.Rngs behaves as expected if the seed is reused or if additional keys are needed during training or evaluation.
Loss Calculation:

You correctly use optax.sigmoid_binary_cross_entropy, which is a good choice for binary classification. Just make sure the logits terminology aligns with the actual output of your model. Since you’re applying a sigmoid after nnx.Linear, the outputs are probabilities. You might consider using optax.binary_cross_entropy if your output is already scaled between 0 and 1, or adjusting the model so that it directly outputs logits and then applying sigmoid only when calculating predictions.
Model Design and Naming:

The naming is clear and straightforward. If you plan to extend the model in the future, consider adding docstrings to the LogisticRegression class and its methods. This makes the code easier to understand for others (and for your future self).
The structure is modular, which will help when you need to swap in different layers or add complexity.
Optimization and Training Loop:

Your training loop is simple and effective. If you find that the model is not converging as expected, you might experiment with the learning rate or the number of epochs.
Printing the loss is helpful for debugging, but once you’re satisfied, consider logging it or storing it for later analysis instead of printing it every step.
Evaluation Method:

You’re using the same loss function during evaluation, which is fine for checking model performance. However, you might also want to calculate a classification metric (like accuracy or F1 score) to get a more intuitive sense of how well the model is performing.
General Best Practices:

Type hints on input shapes and output types can improve readability. For example, consider specifying that x is jnp.ndarray with a certain shape, and the same for y.
Adding some comments or docstrings about what each method does will make your code easier to maintain and understand.
Overall, this is a strong solution! By making these small refinements—particularly around RNG management and evaluating more intuitive metrics—you’ll have a robust, well-structured logistic regression implementation with Flax NNX.
